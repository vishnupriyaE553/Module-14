## PRIORITY QUEUE

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program for simple implementation of Priority Queue using Queue.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.  
2. Define a class `PriorityQueue` with an initializer to create an empty list `queue`.  
3. Define the `__str__` method to return queue elements as a string separated by spaces.  
4. Define the `isEmpty()` method to check if the queue is empty.  
5. Define the `insert(data)` method to append the given data to the queue.  
6. Define the `delete()` method to:  
   - Initialize `max_val` as 0.  
   - Loop through the queue and find the index of the maximum value.  
   - Delete and return the element at that index.  
7. In the main code, take integer input `n` for number of elements.  
8. Loop `n` times to take input values and insert them into the priority queue.  
9. Print the contents of the queue.  
10. While the queue is not empty, call `delete()` and print each returned element.  
11. End the program.
